# Pylox

A python implementation of the tree walk interpreter of the language Lox. Here are some of the notes that I have while implementing pylox.

## Scanner
The scanner converts the source code `src: str` into a list of tokens, which then goes into the next stage, the interpreter.

Key concepts:
- The scanner here is implemented with a stateful, single-pass counter that tracks the position of a pointer as it moves through the source code, and uses many functions that rely on the current position of a pointer to add the current token.
    - Real life alternatives:
      - Scanner Generator tools (eg. Lex) use regular expression rules and finite automata to generate scanners automatically from a high-level specification. Used by GNU, Clang, LLVM etc.
      - Regex based manual tokenization (eg. Python's `re.Scanner`).
      - Multistage tokenizers (eg. IDEs like VS Code, Rust compiler) have multiple passes that do things like remove comments & whitespace, then handle macro tokens and interpolation, then token classification.

- In the `scan_token` method, we try to encapsulate the simpler cases with `dict` mappings, but resort to pattern matching with `match-case` for the more complicated cases.

- Maximal Munch (longest match): we always match the longest possible token, eg. resolving `---a` as `-- -a` instead of `- --a`. Multiple tokens may begin with the same prefix, so we try to consume as many characters as possible that still make a valid token. It helps with correctness in misinterpreting longer tokens as multiple shorter ones, while helping the grammar and parsing to remain simple.

# Representing code
Key terms:
- Formal grammar: Using a set of atomic pieces as its 'alphabet', we define a (usually infinite) set of 'strings' that are in the grammar. Since these grammars have infinite valid strings, we define them using a set of rules, called productions as they produce strings in the grammar.
- In a Context-free grammar, each rule can be applied regardless of what comes before or after (ie. independent of its surrounding symbols).
- Each production in a context-free grammar has a head and a body. The head is a name and describes what the body generates. eg. (`unary → ( "!" | "-" ) unary | call ;`) 

## Generating the AST
- Since each kind of expression in Lox behaves differently at runtime, the interpreter needs to select a different chunk of code to handle each expression type
- We use the visitor pattern: The interpreter implements a visitor, and thus has `visit_x_expression` implemented. 
  - If we have a `Expr` like `assignment: Expr = Assign(...)`
  - We evaluate it like `result: Object = assignment.accept(interpreter)`
  - Under the hood:
    1. `assignment.accept(interpreter)`
    2. We call `interpreter.visit_assign_expr(self)`
    3. as `Interpreter` implements `Visitor`, it has a method `visit_assign_expr` that performs evaluation specific to Assign expressions
  - This is a double dispatch:
    - First: Runtime type of `Expr` determines which accept is called
    - Second: `accept()` calls the correct `visit_x_expr` on the visitor.
  
- Some typing notes:
  - We use `abc.ABC` to for expression type `Expr` where explicit inheritance is intended.
  - We use `typing.Protocol` for `Visitor` to enable duck typing and to keep things flexible.
  - We also use `dataclasses.dataclass` for the `Expr` subclasses to reduce the boilerplate `__init__` needed otherwise, and also `frozen` enabled us to have immutability.

## Parsing
- Pylox, like jlox implements a Recursive Descent Parser (top-down parser).
- Our parser takes in a sequence of `Tokens` and uses the ordering to build a AST based off the Lox Grammar specification.
- Our implementation is a stateful, single pass parser that maintains a reference to the current token we are at. We move down the Lox grammar, from expressions of lower precedence to those of higher precedence.

   * Expression Grammar
   * ======================
   *
   * expression → assignment ;
   * 
   * assignment → (call ".")? IDENTIFIER "=" assignment | logic_or ;
   * 
   * logic_or → logic_and ("or" logic_and)* ;
   * 
   * logic_and → equality ("and" equality)* ;
   * 
   * equality → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
   * 
   * comparison → term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
   * 
   * term → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
   * 
   * factor → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
   * 
   * unary → ( "!" | "-" ) unary | call ;
   * 
   * // Includes calls and property access
   * call → primary ( "(" arguments? ")" | "." IDENTIFIER )* ;
   * arguments → expression ( "," expression )* ;
   * 
   * primary → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" | "(" expression ")"
   * | IDENTIFIER | "super" "." IDENTIFIER;


   * Statement Grammar
   * ==================
   * 
   * program → declaration* EOF ;
   * 
   * declaration → classDecl | funDecl | varDecl | statement ;
   * 
   * statement → exprStmt | forStmt | ifStmt | printStmt | returnStmt | whileStmt
   * | block ;
   * 
   * block → "{" declaration* "}" ;
   * 
   * forStmt → "for" "(" ( varDecl | exprStmt | ";" )
   * expression? ";"
   * expression ")" statement ;
   * 
   * returnStmt → "return" expression? ";" ;
   * 
   * ifStmt → "if" "(" expression ")" statement ("else" statement)? ;
   * 
   * classDecl → "class" IDENTIFIER ( "<" IDENTIFIER )? "{" function* "}";
   * 
   * funDecl → "fun" function ;
   * function → IDENTIFIER "(" parameters? ")" block ;
   * parameters → IDENTIFIER ( "," IDENTIFIER )* ;
   * 
   * varDecl → "var" IDENTIFIER ( "=" expression)? ";" ;
   * 
   * printStmt → expression ";" ;
   * exprStmt → "print" expression ";" ;
```

## Interpreting
After building the AST, we need to evaluate the AST. This comes in two parts, and we achieve that by way of an interpreter.
1. Expressions
  - Given an expression, we want to evaluate it to some result (and possible with side effects).
  - Our interpreter implements the Visitor Protocol, that is to say it is able to visit each of the different types of the AST nodes. Upon visiting a node, it evaluates its value and any of its associated side effects.
2. Statements
